	The International Scholarship Program for Graduate Ford Foundation in Brazil, in operation between 2002 and 2009, conducted eight rounds of selection for scholarships that allowed awardees to attaing master's and doctoral degrees.  The Carlos Chagas Foundation, a private nonprofit organization, founded in 1964 and dedicated to the assessment of cognitive and professional skills and research in education, was selected to run the IFP program in Brazil as an international partner. The IFP Brazil Office was headed by Fulvia Rosemberg, a researcher in the Department of Educational Research of the Carlos Chagas Foundation. The IFP program in Brazil had some distinctive features stemming from its context of intense ongoing national debate over affirmative action in higher education. Thus, the IFP program in Brazil was presented, since its launch, as an affirmative action program, to the extent that their target audience is people underrepresented in graduate school. The goal of the program is to provide preferential treatment to certain social groups that due to the social structure of the country, would normally have the least possibility of access, retention and success in postgraduate education. Each year, the IFP has offered about 40 scholarships for master's (24 months) and Doctorate (up to 36 months), to the social groups with the worst indicators of access to postgraduate education, according to National Household Survey of 2003.  Another characteristic of the IFP program in Brazil was its attempt to balance the respect for local practices with adjusting the process to the international rules governing the program. By the time the office was closed in 2013, the program in Brazil graduated 306 IFP fellows.

		<p>
	The IFP program in Russia was among the four pilot IFP programs. In October 2000 the Ford Foundation invited the Moscow office of the Institute of International Education, to develop and manage the program, and, it was launched in November 2001 in close consultation with the Moscow office of the Ford Foundation and representatives of the educational community and NGOs. In the Russian Federation, the program supported candidates who reside outside of large metropolitan areas, persons with disabilities, refugees, internally displaced persons, and individuals who were raised in orphanages or state-supported boarding schools. The fellows were selected in 2001-2009 by an independent panel of Russian citizens to which IIE-Moscow acts as secretariat. Fellows of the program, whose number eventually reached 255, represented 77 regions of the Russian Federation, with 171  of them going for a Master-level degree and 84 for a Ph. D. About sixty percent of the Fellows chose to attend graduate schools in Russia; others went to study abroad, predominantly in the US, Canada, European countries. Alumni Association of IFP in the Russian Federation was established in 2005 in order to enable graduates of the program to implement joint projects, communicate and to be aware of the professional interests of each other, and to support each other during the period of &quot;re-adaptation&quot; after the end of the program.

	The Russian IFP office in Moscow was the first international office to close in March 2012. The set of digital materials was delivered in July 2012, and 6 l.f. of paper materials arrived in September 2013. The archived documents include administrative program files, fellow files, publicity materials and audiovisual materials, and the program website. 127 fellows consented to provide researchers with access to their files. The materials are in English and Russian.

		<p>
	One of the major innovations of IFP is a decentralized operational structure linking implementing organizations in the twenty-two IFP participating countries with the IFP Secretariat in New York City, which managed the program as a whole to maintain
	global consistency of policy and implementation. This model of delegating authority stems from the realization that a blueprint approach to selecting Fellows would not be replicable or effective across the diverse human geographies, cultures, educational systems, and socio-economic settings of IFP countries. From the outset the Secretariat worked with IPs to pilot-test, refine, and evaluate approaches for defining, reaching, and selecting the IFP target group. The resulting system is a fine-tuned interplay of local and global features, policy parameters, and implementation strategies. The selection was a local processes, with final authority vested in national selection bodies. Once local selection committees had made their decisions, lists of &quot;Fellows-designate&quot; were reviewed by the IFP Secretariat to ensure overall consistency without overriding the national committee process. The secretariate also monitored the overall performance of the program and collected relevant information from all the participants.  Thus, in 2007, the IFP Secretariat instituted an &quot;alumni census,&quot; which compiles alumni data provided directly by the International Partners and is therefore based on a head count rather than voluntary survey responses. Starting in 2007, a joint CHEPS-IFP alumni survey has been carried out annually.
		</p>
		<p>
	The secretariat was in operation in 2001 - 2013, headed by Executive Director Joan Dassin. Joan coordinated the initial design process for IFP, which began in December 1999, and assumed the position of Executive Director of IFP when the organization was created in April 2001. She was responsible for overall coordination of the IFP worldwide and the IFP evaluation project, worked closely with several outside consultants on program communications, and also oversaw all aspects of program implementation in Latin America. The secretariat staff also included
	Mary Zurbuchen (Director for Asia and Russia); Rob Oppegard (Director of Finance &amp; Administration), Barbara Wanasek (Grants Manager), Alan Divack (Senior Project Manager, Archives and Knowledge Management), Diana Whitten (Director of Communications), Rachel Clift (Communications Officer), Daniel Reisner (Multimedia and Archives Officer) and Adriana Thoen(Administrative Manager). The Secretariat archival records on paper comprise 160 l.f.; a large digital archive (over 3.5 TB) includes a multimedia library and digitized audiovisual materials, in addition to administrative and program files.
