The Ford Foundation International Fellowships Program for in Brazil, in operation in 2002 through 2009, conducted eight rounds of selection for graduate scholarships, which allowed awardees to attain master's and doctoral degrees in the areas of their choice. The Carlos Chagas Foundation, a private nonprofit organization, founded in 1964 and dedicated to the assessment of cognitive and professional skills and research in education, was selected to run the program as an international partner. The IFP Brazil Office was headed by Fulvia Rosemberg, a researcher in the Department of Educational Research of the Carlos Chagas Foundation. The IFP program in Brazil had some distinctive features stemming from its context of intense ongoing national debate over affirmative action in higher education. The IFP program was presented as an affirmative action program, to the extent that it targeted people generally underrepresented in graduate schools. The goal of the program was to provide preferential treatment to certain social groups that, due to the social structure of the country, normally had the least possibility of access, retention and success in postgraduate education. Each year, IFP offered about 40 scholarships for masterâ€™s degree (24 months) and doctorate (up to 36 months) degrees to the social groups which,  according to National Household Survey of 2003, had the worst indicators of access to postgraduate education,. Another characteristic of the IFP program in Brazil was its attempt to balance the respect for local practices with the international rules governing the program. The program in Brazil graduated 306 IFP Fellows by the time the office was closed in 2013.

The IFP program in Guatemala, since its inception in 2001, was under technical and administrative management of the Regional Research Center of Mesoamerica (CIRMA), an IFP international partner. One of CIRMA's key objectives is to support programs to facilitate wider access of the Guatemalan population to education. The IFP program in the country was directed at Guatemalans and Central Americans, living in the country, who belonged to social groups and communities with limited access to education and had a history of working for the development of Guatemala. Recipients were selected based on their leadership potential, social commitment of their careers, as well as academic excellence. Between 2001 and 2010, 127 Guatemalans received IFP scholarships to complete graduate studies. The CIRMA also ran the monitoring program, which included support in the search for top universities around the world, strengthening and remedial education prior to starting graduate studies, counseling sessions, as well as participation in learning activities and discussions designed for sharing experiences with large and diverse audiences. Currently, the program supports the creation of a network of scholars, generating opportunities for dialogue, discussion and reflection on topics linked to the various disciplines and areas of intervention in the national context. CIRMA continues to maintain the site of the IFP Guatemala Alumni Association (<a href=\"http://www.ifpguatemala.org\">www.ifpguatemala.org</a>).

In 2001 the Ford Foundation appointed a team to develop and manage IFP in India. In close consultation with the New Delhi office of the Ford Foundation and with the advice of experienced academics and social scientists, the IFP India team launched the program in April 2001. Its operations were housed at the United States India Educational Foundation (USIEF), New Delhi, which acted as the IFP International Partner in the country. IFP India aimed to support individuals from disadvantaged groups that lacked access to higher education due to various forms of socio-economic deprivation, including those living in geographically remote areas. After an initial all-India intake, the India program concentrated on specific states including Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. The selection of Fellows was performed by an independent selection panel of Indian citizens from academia and civil society, to which the IFP team acted as secretariat. Many of the 330 Fellows came from small towns and rural areas across India, many were first generation literates, 47% were women, 13% came from Scheduled Castes, 13% from Scheduled Tribes, 26% - from Other Backward Classes, 34% belonged to religious minority groups, and  4% had physical challenges. 45% of the IFP Fellows from India went to graduate schools in the United States, 45% to the UK, while the remaining award recipients attended universities in Europe, Asia and Australia. After the Fellows' return to India, IFP helped Alumni to re-integrate into their home environments with the support of the Alumni networks across the states of India.

The IFP program in Russia was among the four pilot IFP programs. In October 2000 the Ford Foundation invited the Moscow office of the Institute of International Education to develop and manage the program and it was launched in November 2001 in close consultation with the Moscow office of the Ford Foundation and representatives of the educational community and NGOs. In the Russian Federation, the program supported candidates who reside outside of large metropolitan areas, persons with disabilities, refugees, internally displaced persons, and individuals who were raised in orphanages or state-supported boarding schools. The Fellows were selected in 2001-2009 by an independent panel of Russian citizens to which IIE-Moscow acted as secretariat. Fellows of the program, whose number eventually reached 255, represented 77 regions of the Russian Federation, with 171 of them going for a master-level degree and 84 for a doctorate. About sixty percent of the Fellows chose to attend graduate schools in Russia; others went to study abroad, predominantly in the US, Canada, European countries. Alumni Association of IFP in the Russian Federation was established in 2005 in order to enable graduates of the program to implement joint projects, communicate and to be aware of the professional interests of each other, and to support each other during the period of &quot;re-adaptation&quot; after the end of the program.

The Russian IFP office in Moscow was the first international office to close in March 2012. The set of digital materials was delivered in July 2012, and 6 linear feet of paper materials arrived in September 2013. The archived documents include administrative program files, fellow files, publicity materials and audiovisual materials, and the program website. 127 Fellows consented to provide researchers with access to their files. The materials are in English and Russian.

		<p>
One of the major innovations of the Ford Foundation International Fellowships Program was a decentralized operational structure linking implementing organizations in the twenty-two participating countries with the Secretariat in New York City, which managed the program as a whole to maintain global consistency of policy and implementation. This model of delegating authority stemmed from the realization that a blueprint approach to selecting Fellows could not be replicable or effective across the diverse human geographies, cultures, educational systems, and socio-economic settings of the IFP countries. From the outset, the Secretariat worked with its local partners to pilot-test, refine, and evaluate approaches for defining, reaching, and selecting IFP target groups. The resulting system was a fine-tuned interplay of local and global features, policy parameters, and implementation strategies. The selection was a local process, with final authority vested in national selection bodies. Once local selection committees had made their decisions, lists of \"Fellows-designate\" were reviewed by the Secretariat to ensure overall consistency without overriding the national committee process. The Secretariat also monitored the overall performance of the program and collected relevant information from all the participants. Thus, in 2007, the Secretariat instituted an Alumni Census, which compiled the Alumni data provided directly by the International Partners and was, therefore, based on a head count rather than voluntary survey responses. Starting in 2007, a joint CHEPS-IFP Alumni Survey has been carried out annually.
		</p>
		<p>
The Secretariat was in operation in 2001 - 2013, headed by Executive Director Joan Dassin. Joan coordinated the initial design process for IFP, which began in December 1999, and assumed the position of IFP Executive Director when the organization was created in April 2001. She was responsible for overall coordination and evaluation of the program worldwide, worked closely with several outside consultants on program communications and also oversaw all aspects of program implementation in Latin America. The Secretariat staff also included Mary Zurbuchen (Director for Asia and Russia), Rob Oppegard (Director of Finance & Administration), Barbara Wanasek (Grants Manager), Alan Divack (Senior Project Manager, Archives and Knowledge Management), Diana Whitten (Director of Communications), Rachel Clift (Communications Officer), Daniel Reisner (Multimedia and Archives Officer) and Adriana Thoen (Administrative Manager).
		</p>
		<p>
The Secretariat archival records on paper comprise 160 l.f.; its large archive of digital materials (over 3.5 TB) includes administrative and program files, a multimedia library and digitized audiovisual materials.
